# AR_Transport-Logistics
 Advanced E-Commerce: The integration of augmented reality technology in shopping malls
To make the augmented reality (AR) virtual try-on experience more advanced and closer to an actual e-commerce integration, we can extend the functionality in the following ways:

1. **Advanced Pose Detection**: Improve the accuracy of detecting body parts using Mediapipe and OpenCV.
2. **Clothing Simulation**: Create more advanced clothing simulations that adjust to body shape and movements.
3. **Product Catalog Integration**: Connect to an e-commerce API or simulate a catalog with clothing and accessories.
4. **User Interaction**: Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to select products and manage the try-on experience.
5. **Size and Fit Estimation**: Simulate size and fit by allowing the user to input body dimensions or use AI-driven estimates.

### Full Program Outline

1. **Dependencies**: The extended program requires the following libraries:
   - `opencv-python`
   - `mediapipe`
   - `numpy`
   - `pygame`
   - `tkinter` (for GUI)
   - `requests` (for API integration, if needed)

   Install these dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pygame tkinter requests
   ```

2. **GUI for Product Selection**: Use Tkinter to create a simple GUI for the user to select products from the catalog.

3. **Dynamic Clothing Overlay**: Instead of a static image, dynamically adjust the overlay based on user movements and size.

### Step 1: Enhanced Pose Detection and GUI for Product Selection

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
import numpy as np
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
import requests
from PIL import Image, ImageTk

# Initialize Mediapipe for pose detection
mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
pose = mp_pose.Pose()

# Function to overlay an accessory (e.g., clothing) on the image
def overlay_image(background, overlay, position):
    x, y = position
    h, w = overlay.shape[:2]
    alpha_overlay = overlay[:, :, 3] / 255.0  # Get alpha channel for transparency
    alpha_background = 1.0 - alpha_overlay

    for c in range(0, 3):
        background[y:y+h, x:x+w, c] = (alpha_overlay * overlay[:, :, c] + 
                                       alpha_background * background[y:y+h, x:x+w, c])

    return background

# GUI Class for Product Selection
class ProductSelector(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("AR Try-On Product Selector")
        self.geometry("400x200")
        
        self.label = tk.Label(self, text="Select a product to try on:")
        self.label.pack(pady=20)

        self.product_button = tk.Button(self, text="Choose Product", command=self.select_product)
        self.product_button.pack(pady=20)

        self.selected_product = None

    def select_product(self):
        # Open file dialog to select a product image
        file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[("PNG Files", "*.png")])
        if file_path:
            self.selected_product = file_path
            self.label.config(text=f"Selected: {file_path.split('/')[-1]}")

# Function to simulate loading a product catalog (can be connected to an API)
def load_product_catalog():
    # Simulated catalog for demonstration purposes
    catalog = [
        {"name": "Hat", "image": "hat.png"},
        {"name": "Sunglasses", "image": "sunglasses.png"}
        # Add more products here
    ]
    return catalog

# Initialize GUI and Product Catalog
product_selector = ProductSelector()
product_catalog = load_product_catalog()

# Run the GUI in a separate thread or the main thread
product_selector.mainloop()

# Check if a product has been selected
if product_selector.selected_product:
    product_image = cv2.imread(product_selector.selected_product, cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)
else:
    print("No product selected. Exiting...")
    exit()

# Open webcam feed
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Convert the frame to RGB
    rgb_frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    
    # Detect pose landmarks
    result = pose.process(rgb_frame)
    
    if result.pose_landmarks:
        # Get key points (e.g., nose for placing the hat)
        nose = result.pose_landmarks.landmark[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.NOSE]
        nose_coords = (int(nose.x * frame.shape[1]), int(nose.y * frame.shape[0]))
        
        # Overlay the selected product (e.g., clothing) on the body
        frame = overlay_image(frame, product_image, nose_coords)
    
    # Show the frame
    cv2.imshow("AR Try-On", frame)
    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Step 2: Dynamic Clothing Simulation

To make the clothing dynamic and responsive to user movements, we can extend the program to adjust the clothingâ€™s position and size based on the detected landmarks, like shoulders and hips.

```python
# Function to dynamically resize and position the overlay image (e.g., clothing)
def dynamic_clothing_overlay(background, overlay, landmarks):
    # Example: Position between shoulders
    left_shoulder = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_SHOULDER]
    right_shoulder = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.RIGHT_SHOULDER]

    # Calculate the center point and scale of the overlay
    center_x = int((left_shoulder.x + right_shoulder.x) / 2 * background.shape[1])
    center_y = int((left_shoulder.y + right_shoulder.y) / 2 * background.shape[0])
    
    shoulder_width = int(abs(left_shoulder.x - right_shoulder.x) * background.shape[1])
    
    # Resize overlay to fit between shoulders
    resized_overlay = cv2.resize(overlay, (shoulder_width, int(overlay.shape[0] * (shoulder_width / overlay.shape[1]))))
    
    # Overlay on background
    overlay_position = (center_x - resized_overlay.shape[1] // 2, center_y - resized_overlay.shape[0] // 2)
    return overlay_image(background, resized_overlay, overlay_position)

# Modify the loop to use dynamic_clothing_overlay
if result.pose_landmarks:
    # Use dynamic clothing overlay based on shoulder points
    frame = dynamic_clothing_overlay(frame, product_image, result.pose_landmarks.landmark)
```

### Step 3: E-commerce Integration (Simulated)

We can simulate e-commerce integration by loading products from a simulated API or file and allowing the user to select products from a catalog. For a real implementation, you could connect to a back-end server using `requests` to fetch products, pricing, and availability.

### Step 4: Size and Fit Estimation

To estimate size and fit, we could prompt the user for their body measurements and adjust the virtual try-on accordingly. Alternatively, we could implement a machine learning model to predict size and fit based on user images.

### Conclusion

This extended program improves upon the basic AR experience by adding a GUI for product selection, dynamic resizing of virtual items, and the potential for e-commerce integration. For further enhancement, you could:
- Integrate a real e-commerce API.
- Add support for multiple body landmarks (e.g., full body tracking).
- Implement more advanced image processing and machine learning techniques for accurate size and fit estimation. 

This setup can be used as a foundation for a more sophisticated virtual try-on application.
